I am an **incoming PhD Student at EPFL** with a strong background in autonomous systems, machine learning, and applied mathematics. My career spans both industry and academia, with hands-on experience in research, robotics, and innovative product development.

Before, I served as the **Lead Control Engineer at Yamaha Motor Corporation's Marine Innovation Division** in Kennesaw, GA. In this role, I designed **advanced marine control systems**, lead collaborations with research institutions, and developed **cutting-edge driver assistance systems (ADAS)** for recreational boats. My work not only advanced marine technology, but also contributed to industry-wide safety standard in collaboration with the **American Boat and Yacht Council (ABYC)**.

Previously, I developed **low- and high-level control algorithms** for Yamaha's [**auto-docking product DockPoint**](https://vimeo.com/798535908/44e54a1bf0), the first of its kind for recreational boats, ensuring alignment with technical standards and spearheading its market release.

Before joining Yamaha, I pursued two master's degrees:

  <div><strong>Master of Engineering Cybernetics</strong> at the <a href="https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/">University of Stuttgart</a>, focusing on <b> nonlinear dynamics </b> and <b> systems theory </b>.</div>
</div> 

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <img src="{{ '/images/logos/GeorgiaTech_RGB.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Georgia Tech" width="120">
  <div><strong>Master of Engineering Science and Mechanics</strong> at the <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>, where I applied <b> deep learning </b> and <b> computer vision </b> for material characterization using high-performance computing.</div>
</div>

Throughout my acadmic journey, I conducted research across multiple countries, including an **exchange at the University of Padua** and collaborative work at **Georgia Tech's Nondestructive Evaluation Lab**. I excel at integrating machine learning with engineering disciplines, having trained **CNNs** to predict material properties with ultrasonic waves. Additionally, I worked with **real-time robotic control systems** at the University of Stuttgart, where I developed control strategies for the quadrupedal robot RAMbi.

In my free time, I enjoy producing electronic music, playing the piano, and DJing. I'm also passionate about recreational sports both indoor like MMA and team handball, and outdoor like skiing and scuba diving, which balances my technical work with creative and physical challenges.

Whether developing innovative marine technology, producing music, or pursuing research, I thrive at the intersection of creativity, engineering, and leadership.
