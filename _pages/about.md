I am a **German-American control engineer** with a strong background in autonomous systems, machine learning, and applied mathematics. My carreer spans both industry and academia, with hands-on experience in research, robotics, and innovative product development.

Currently, I serve as the **Lead Control Engineer at Yamaha Motor Corporation's Marine Innovation Division** in Kennesaw, GA. In this role, I design **advanced marine control systems**, lead collaborations with research institutions, and develop **cutting-edge driver assistance systems (ADAS)** for recreational boats. My work not only advances marine technology, but also contributes to industry-wide safety standard incollaboration with the **American Boat and Yacht Council (ABYC)**.

Previously, I developed **low- and high-level control algorithms** for Yamaha's [**auto-docking product DockPoint**](https://vimeo.com/798535908/44e54a1bf0), the first of its kind for recreational boats, encusing alignment with technical standards and spearheading its market release.

Before joining Yamaha, I pursied two master's degrees:
- **Master of Engineering Cybernetics** from the [**University of Stuttgart**](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/), focusing on **nonlinear dynamics** and **systems theory**.
- **Master of Engineering Science and Mechanics** from the [**Georgia Institute of Technology**](https://www.gatech.edu/), where I applied **deep learning** and **computer vision** for material characterization using high-performance computing.

Throughout my acadmic journey, I conducted research across multiple countries, including an **exchange at the University of Padua** and collaborative work at **Georgia Tech's Nondestructive Evaluation Lab**. I excel at integrating machine learning with engineering disciplines, having trained **CNNs** to predict material properties with ultrasonic waves. Additionally, I worked with **real-time robotic control systems** at the University of Stuttgart, where I developed control strategies for the quadrupedal robot RAMbi.

In my free time, I enjoy producing electronic music, playing the piano, and DJing. I'm also passionate about recreational sports both indoor like MMA and team handball, and outdoor like skiing and scuba diving, which balances my technical work with creative and physical challenges.

Whether developing innovative marine technology, producing music, or pursing research, I thrive at the intersection of creativity, engineering, and leadership.

I am a German-American graduate student studying engineering cybernetics at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/)
and just graduated with a master's in engineering science and mechanics from the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) in the spring of 2022.

I consider myself as a roboticist, combining an expansive background in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision with strong roots in applied math and engineering (e.g. (nonlinear-)mechanics and advanced control). 
I develop intelligent systems and interacting agents that perceive and learn from data to make intelligent decisions about how to manipulate their environment to make people's life easier and safer. My unique background from two master's programs and studying in three different countries expedited me to understand various approaches to the same problem. It enables me to creatively solve problems that arise from these highly complex tasks, and I work as a knowledge broker to succeed even with the greatest challenges.

In 2021, I did an exchange semester studying information engineering at the University of Padua in Italy, which gave me the opportunity to dive into the fascinating world of natural language processing while connecting with a lot of international students.

Previously, I was at the Georgia Tech campus in Atlanta doing research under the supervision of [Prof. Laurence J. Jacobs](https://ce.gatech.edu/people/faculty/761/overview).
In my research at Georgia Tech, I was analyzing the use of machine learning with focus on convolutional neural networks for the inversion of ultrasonic waves in layered media with a thin coating. I excelled at upscaling the necessary computations (FEM simulations, 2D-FFT postprocessing, CNN training) to use the Georgia Tech high performance cluster. This way, I applied a computer vision based approach to material science.[^1]

Before I started my Master in Engineering Science and Mechanics, I started another master in engineering cybernetics at the University of Stuttgart in Germany, focusing on autonomous systems, systems theory and nonlinear dynamics. In Stuttgart, I worked for the [Institute of Nonlinear Dynamics](https://www.inm.uni-stuttgart.de) under the supervision of [Prof. C. David Remy](https://www.inm.uni-stuttgart.de/en/institut/employees/Remy/) on controlling and communcating with the quadrupedal robot RAMbi. I got proficient in controlling this real-time robot system with EtherCAT and Simulink Real-Time. I am currently in the process of finishing my graduate program from Stuttgart and am open to work offers.

When I am not working on my research, I most probably produce music, practice playing piano or work as a DJ/freelance music producer.
