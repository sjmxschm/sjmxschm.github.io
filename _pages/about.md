I am a graduate student studying engineering cybernetics at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/)
and engineering science and mechanics at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/).

Currently, I am doing an exchange semester studying information engineering at the University of Padua in Italy. Before that, I wwas at Georgia Tech campus in Atlanta doing research under the supervision of [Prof. Laurence J. Jacobs](https://ce.gatech.edu/people/faculty/761/overview).
In my research here at Georgia Tech I am analyzing the use of machine learning with focus on convolutional neural networks for the inversion of ultrasonic waves in layered media with a thin coating. I excelled at upscaling the necessary computations (FEM simulations, 2D-FFT postprocessing, CNN training) to use the Georgia Tech high performance cluster. This way, I applied a computer vision based approach to material science.[^1]

Before I started my Master in Engineering Science and Mechanics, I started another master in engineering cybernetics at the University of Stuttgart in Germany, focusing on autonomous systems, systems theory and nonlinear dynamics. In Stuttgart, I worked for the [Institute of Nonlinear Dynamics](https://www.inm.uni-stuttgart.de) under the supervision of [Prof. David C. Remy](https://www.inm.uni-stuttgart.de/en/institut/employees/Remy/) on controlling and communcating with the quadrupedal robot RAMbi. I got proficient in controlling this real-time robot system with EtherCAT and Simulink Real-Time.

My research interests lay at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning (deep learning, reinforcement learning) and robotics.

When I am not working on my research, I most probably produce music, practice playing piano or work as a DJ.
