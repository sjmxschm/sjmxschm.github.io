I am a graduate student studying engineering cybernetics at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/)
and engineering science and mechanics at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.gatech.edu/).

Currently, I am at Georgia Tech campus in Atlanta doing research under the supervision
of [Prof. Laurence J. Jacobs](https://ce.gatech.edu/people/faculty/761/overview).
In my research here at Georgia Tech I am analyzing the use of machine learning with focus on convolutional
neural networks for the inversion of ultrasonic waves in layered media with a thin coating.

Before I started my Master in Engineering Science and Mechanics, I started another Master in engineering science and mechanics at the University of Stuttgart in Germany, focusing on autonomous systems and nonlinear dynamics. In Stuttgart, I worked for the [Institute of Nonlinear Dynamics](https://www.inm.uni-stuttgart.de) under the supervision of [Prof. David C. Remy](https://www.inm.uni-stuttgart.de/en/institut/employees/Remy/) on controlling and communcating with the quadrupedal robot RAMbi.

My research interests lay at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning (deel learning, reinforcement learning) and robotics.
