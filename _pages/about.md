I am a graduate student studying engineering cybernetics at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/)
and engineering science and mechanics at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.gatech.edu/).

Currently, I am at Georgia Tech campus in Atlanta doing research under the supervision
of Prof [Laurence J. Jacobs](https://ce.gatech.edu/people/faculty/761/overview).
In my research here at Georgia Tech I am analyzing the use of convolutional
neural networks for the inversion of ultrasonic waves.
