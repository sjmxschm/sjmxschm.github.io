Music is and has always been an extremely important part of my life -- no matter if it was playing the piano for myself or being the DJ for thousands of people. Since my research at University of Stuttgart and at Georgia Tech was really time consuming, I am only barely creating new content currently. Anyway, you can find my 'former' DJ website [here](https://www.djmakz.de/), my [Soundcloud profile here](https://soundcloud.com/makz-969860584) (which usually is the most up-do-date page of my releases), and [Spotify here](https://open.spotify.com/artist/34vYufP5UYwhMAqZiPeeEq?si=pwC58am2SveDUN4N0dRDWw).

If you are interested in hiring me as a music producer, feel free to [directly reach out to me](mailto:m.schmitz096@outlook.com) or visit my [Fiverr freelancer profile](https://www.fiverr.com/makzsounds?up_rollout=true).
