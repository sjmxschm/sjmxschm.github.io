Music is and has always been an extremely important part of my life -- no matter if it was playing the piano for myself or being the DJ for thousands of people. Since my research at University of Stuttgart and at Georgia Tech was really time consuming, I had to ramp down my output. Currently, I try to release 1-2 songs per year. To stay up-to-date, you can find my [Soundcloud profile here](https://soundcloud.com/makz-969860584) (this usually is the most up-do-date page of my releases), [Spotify here](https://open.spotify.com/artist/34vYufP5UYwhMAqZiPeeEq?si=pwC58am2SveDUN4N0dRDWw), my 'former' DJ website [here](https://www.djmakz.de/).

If you are interested in hiring me as a music producer, feel free to [directly reach out to me](mailto:m.schmitz096@outlook.com) since I currently stopped working for [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/makzsounds?up_rollout=true).
