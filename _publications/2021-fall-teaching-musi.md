Hold invited guest lecture on production of Electronic Dance Music (EDM) within the class MUSI6103 by [Prof. Nat Condit-Schultz](https://music.gatech.edu/nat-condit-schultz) at the Georgia Institute of Technology. EDM is a popular field of music, though the spread and popularity is limited in the US. My talk helped to give an understanding of what EDM is, what it sounds like, and what fundamental production methods exist.

The lecture consisted out of two parts:

1. Introduction to EDM slides,
2. Hands on examples while working within Cubase.

While I was not allowed to record the lecture during the class, you can access and download the  <a href="https://github.com/sjmxschm/sjmxschm.github.io/raw/f2d23b1b0b94d57f058b0aedc03c366efe475732/files/11232021_Intro_2_EDM_production_slides.pdf">slides from part 1</a> of the presentation.
